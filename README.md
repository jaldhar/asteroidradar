# Asteroid Radar

This is my submission for the "Building Features for Android App" project of the Udacity Android
Kotlin Developer nanodegree.

In order to compile this app you will need an API key from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/).
Once you have it create a file called `app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml`.
It should look like this:

    <resources>
        <string name="api_key">YOUR API KEY</string>
    </resources>

**DO NOT EVER commit this file into a public version control repository!**
